I could not for the life of me figure out how to make the jar work for this project. So unfortunatley the way to run my 
code is not the best.

In order to use my code you will have to pull the repository from github into intellij and then use the Gradle run build
and run commands. I am using java 11 in case you need to specify a java version.

I am not sure how Gradle projects work in other coding environments such as Eclipse. I am pretty sure when you pull the 
project from Github that Intellij will recognize it as a Gradle project and you will recieve the menu that appears on 
the right side of the screen

Sorry for any difficulties this may cause.
